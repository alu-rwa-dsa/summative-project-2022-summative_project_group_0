# DSA Summative Project: Interactive Syllabi Guide 

The Problem:
“Most full-scale courses in software development and engineering are too expensive for those seeking to become self-taught. Given the saturation of resources online, those who can not afford it often find themselves lost and unsure of where to start their journeys.”
 
This program is an interactive guide for self taught tech professionals/ students in web/app development, software engineering and development, and data science. This program targets middle to low income groups in Africa, and the purpose is to lift the time and financial burden of sourcing syllabi for the career paths. As a result, they are able to spend more time and financial resources getting started, gaining, and perfecting their skills.
 
The program works in a way that allows users to enter their preferred career path, having provided a drop down of available options. Upon selection a directed graph that outlines the path of the skills the individual needs is displayed.
